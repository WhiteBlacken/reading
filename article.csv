1,"Home to virgin reefs, rare sharks and vast numbers of exotic fish, the Coral Sea is a unique haven of biodiversity off the northeastern coast of Australia. If a proposal by the Australian government goes ahead, the region will also become the world's largest marine protected area, with restrictions or bans on fishing, mining and marine farming.The Coral Sea reserve would cover almost 990 000 square kilometers and stretch as far as 1100 kilometers from the coast. Unveiled recently by environment minister Tony Burke, the proposal would be the last in a series of proposed marine reserves around Australia's coast.But the scheme is attracting criticism from scientists and conservation groups, who argue that the government hasn't gone far enough in protecting the Coral Sea, or in other marine reserves in the coastal network.Hugh Possingham, director of the Centre of Excellence for Environmental Decisions at the University of Queensland, points out that little more than half of the Coral Sea reserve is proposed as ""no take"" area, in which all fishing would be banned. The world's largest existing marine reserve, established last year by the British government in the Indian Ocean, spans 654 000 km2 and is a no-take zone throughout. An alliance of campaigning conversation groups argues that more of the Coral Sea should receive this level of protection.""I would like to have seen more protection for coral reefs, ""says Terry Hughes, director of the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University in Queensland. ""More than 20 of them would be outside the no-take area and vulnerable to catch-and-release fishing"".As Nature went to press, the Australian government had not responded to specific criticisms of the plan. But Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at James Cook University, says that the reserve does ""broadly protect the range of habitats"" in the sea. ""I can testify to the huge effort that government agencies and other organizations have put into trying to understand the ecological values of this vast area,"" he says.Reserves proposed earlier this year for Australia’s southwestern and northwestern coastal regions have also been criticized for failing to give habitats adequate protection. In August, 173 marine scientists signed an open letter to the government saying they were ""greatly concerned, that the proposals for the southwestern region had not been based on the ""core science principles"" of reserves the protected regions were not, for instance, representative of all the habitats in the region, they said.Critics say that the southwestern reserve offers the greatest protection to the offshore areas where commercial opportunities are fewest and where there is little threat to the environment, a contention also levelled at the Coral Sea plan.",海洋保护、政府政策、生物多样性,环境
2,"It is not controversial to say that an unhealthy diet causes bad health. Nor are the basic elements of healthy eating disputed. Obesity raises susceptibility to cancer, and Britain is the six most obese country on Earth. That is a public health emergency. But naming the problem is the easy part. No one disputes the costs in quality of life and depleted health budgets of an obese population, but the quest for solutions gets diverted by ideological arguments around responsibility and choice. And the water is muddied by lobbying from the industries that profit from consumption of obesity-inducing products.Historical precedent suggests that science and politics can overcome resistance from businesses that pollute and poison but it takes time, and success often starts small. So it is heartening to note that a programme in Leeds has achieved a reduction in childhood obesity, becoming the first UK city to reverse a fattening trend. The best results were among younger children and in more deprived areas. When 28% of English children aged two to 15 are obese, a national shift on the scale achieved by Leeds would lengthen hundreds of thousands of lives. A significant factor in the Leeds experience appears to be a scheme called HENRY, which helps parents reward behaviours that preyent obesity in children.Many members of parliament are uncomfortable even with their own government's anti-obesity strategy, since it involves a ""sugar tax"" and a ban on the sale of energy drinks to under-16s. Bans and taxes can be blunt instruments, but their harshest critics can rarely suggest better methods. These critics just oppose regulation itself.The relationship between poor health and inequality is too pronounced for governments to be passive about large-scale intervention. People living in the most deprived areas are four times more prone to die from avoidable causes than counterparts in more affluent places. As the structural nature of public health problems becomes harder to ignore, the complaint about overprotective government loses potency.In fact, the polarized debate over public health interventions should have been abandoned long ago. Government action works when individuals are motivated to respond. Individuals need governments that expand access to good choices. The HENRY programme was delivered in part through children's centers. Closing such centers and cutting council budgets doesn't magically increase reserves of individual self-reliance. The function of a well-designed state intervention is not to deprive people of liberty but to build social capacity and infrastructure that helps people take responsibility for their wellbeing. The obesity crisis will not have a solution devised by left or right ideology, but experience indicates that the private sector needs the incentive of regulation before it starts taking public health emergencies seriously.",公共卫生、肥胖,健康
6,"You can’t see it, smell it, or hear it, and people disagree on how precisely to define it, or where exactly it comes from. It isn’t a school subject or an academic discipline, but it can be learned. It is a quality that is required of artists, but it is also present in the lives of scientists and entrepreneurs. All of us benefit from it and we thrive mentally and spiritually when we are able to wield it. It is a delicate thing, easily stamped out; in fact, it flourishes most fully when people are playful and childlike. Meanwhile, it works best in conjunction with deep knowledge and expertise.This mysterious but teachable quality is creativity, the subject of a recently published report by Durham Commission on Creativity and Education; The report concludes that creativity should not inhabit the school curriculum only as it relates to drama, music, art and other obviously creative subjects, but that creative thinking ought to run through all of school life, infusing the way humanities and natural sciences are learned.The authors, who focus on education in England, offer a number of sensible recommendations, some of which are an attempt to alleviate the uninspiring and fact-based approach to education that has crept into policy in recent years. When children are regarded as vessels to be filled with facts, creativity does not prosper; nor does it when teachers’ sole objective is coaching children towards exams. One suggestion from the commission is a network of teacher-led “creativity collaboratives”, along the lines of existing maths hubs, with the aim of supporting teaching for creativity through the school curriculum.Nevertheless, it is arts subjects through which creativity can most obviously be fostered. The value placed on them by the independent education sector is clear. One only has to look at the remarkable arts facilities at Britain’s top private schools to comprehend this. But in the state sector the excessive focus on English, maths and science threatens to crush arts subjects; meanwhile, reduced school budgets mean diminishing extracurricular activities. There has been a 28% decline in students taking creative subjects at high schools since 2014, though happily, art and design have seen a recent increase.This discrepancy between state and private education is a matter of social justice. It is simply wrong and unfair that most children have a fraction of the access to choirs, orchestras, art studios and drama that their more privileged peers enjoy. As lives are affected by any number of looming challenges--climate crisis, automation in the workplace--humans are going to need creative thinking more than ever. For all of our sakes, creativity in education, and for all, must become a priority.",教育、艺术、创造力,教育
7,"Look at the people around you. Some are passive, others more aggressive. Some work best alone, others crave companionship. We easily recognize that there is great variation among the individuals who live near us. Yet, when we speak of people from elsewhere, we seem to inevitably characterize them based on their country of origin.Statistics specialists, when they speak of national averages, often make the same mistake.Newly published research shows how erroneous such overviews are. Three researchers analyzed decades of values-based surveys and found that only between 16% and 21% of the variation in cultural values could be explained by differences between countries. In other words, the vast majority of what makes us culturally distinct from one another has nothing to do with our homeland.To determine what factors really are associated with culture, the authors combined data from 558 prior surveys that each measured one or more of Hofstede's cultural dimensions. These are traits, such as individualism and masculinity, that describe work-related cultural values. (They are not a measure of visible cultural traits, such as food or dress) Though the validity of Hofstede's dimensions has been questioned, they have the singular benefit of having been in use for decades, which allows for historical andThe researchers found that both demographic factors, such as age, and environmental factors, such as long-term unemployment rates, were more correlated with cultural values than nationality. Occupation and social economic status were the most strongly correlated, suggesting that our values are more economically driven than we usually give them credit for.The evidence implies that people with similar jobs and incomes are more culturally alike, regardless of where they live. Vas Taras, the lead author of the study, puts it this way: ""Tell me how much you make and I will make a pretty accurate prediction about your cultural values. Tell me what your nationality is and I probably will make a wrong"".Taras says our erroneous belief that countries are cultures has caused businesses to teach their employees useless or even harmful ways of interacting with their international peers. Chinese and American lawyers might be trained to interact based on the assumption that the Chinese person is less individualistic, even though their similar social economic situations make it probable they are actually quite alike in that regard.The country, as the unit of authority, is often a convenient way of generalizing about a population.However, our focus on countries can mask broad variations within them. In the majority of cases we would be better off identifying people by the factors that constrain their lives, like income, rather than by the lines surrounding them on a map.",文化、价值观,文化

10,"We often think of drawing as something that takes inborn talent, but this kind of thinking stems from our misclassification of drawing as, primarily, an art form rather than a tool for learning.Researchers, teachers, and artists are starting to see how drawing can positively impact a wide variety of skills and disciplines.Most of us have spent some time drawing before, but at some point, most of us stop drawing. There are people who don't, obviously, and thank god for that: a world without designers and artists would be a very shabby one indeed.Some argue that so many adults have abandoned drawing because we've miscategorized it and given it a very narrow definition. In his book, Stick Figures: Drawing as a Human Practice, Professor Dowd argues that we have misfiled the significance of drawing because we see it as a professional skill instead of a personal capacity. We mistakenly think of ""good"" drawings as those which work as recreations of the real world, as realistic illusions. Rather, drawing should be recategorized as a symbolic tool.Human beings have been drawing for 73,000 years. It's part of what it means to be human. We don't have the strength of chimpanzees because we've given up animal strength to manipulate subtle instruments, like hammers, spears, and-later-pens and pencils. The human hand is an extremely dense network of nerve endings. In many ways, human beings are built to draw.Some researchers argue that doodling activates the brain's so-called default circuit--essentially, the areas of the brain responsible for maintaining a baseline level of activity in the absence of other stimuli. Because of this, some believe that doodling during a boring lecture can help students pay attention. In one study, participants were asked to listen to a list of names while either doodling or sitting still. Those who doodled remembered 29 percent more of the names than those who did not.There's also evidence that drawing talent is based on how accurately someone perceives the world. The human visual system tends to misjudge size, shape, color, and angles but artists perceive these qualities more accurately than non-artists. Cultivating drawing talent can become an essential tool to improve people's observational skills in fields where the visual is important.Rather than think of drawing as a talent that some creative people are gifted in, we should consider it as a tool for seeing and understanding the world better-one that just so happens to double as an art form. Both absent-minded doodling and copying from life have been shown to positively affect your memory and visual perception, so complain loudly the next time your school board slashes the art department's budget.",教育、艺术、绘画,教育、文化
11,"About 80 people have been killed during inter-communal clashes in the west of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fighting in Mai-Ndombe province took place on Wednesday and Thursday. Will Ross reports.The clashes were fueled by a long running land dispute. Traditional chiefs from the Teke community see themselves as the rightful owners of the land as they were in the Mai-Ndombe province before the rival Yaka people settled there. This week, a decision was taken to increase the tax to be paid to the Teke chiefs, a move that angered the Yaka community and led to fighting in three areas. The Congolese military intervened to end the violence, but the situation remains extremely tense. In recent months, dozens of people have died and more than 20,000 have been displaced in the same area. State-run media in Syria say at least 86 people are now known to have drowned when a migrant boat sank on Thursday near the city of Tartus. Up to 150 people were thought to have been on board, mainly Syrian, Lebanese, and Palestinian.The boat set off from northern Lebanon on Tuesday.

16,"While human achievements in mathematics continue to reach new levels of complexity, many of us who aren't mathematicians at heart (or engineers by trade) may struggle to remember the last time we used calculus.It's a fact not lost on American educators, who amid rising math failure rates are debating how math can better meet the real-life needs of students. Should we change the way math is taught in schools, or eliminate some courses entirely.Andrew Hacker, Queens College political science professor, thinks that advanced algebra and other higher-level math should be cut from curricula in favor of courses with more routine usefulness, like statistics.""We hear on all sides that we're not teaching enough mathematics, and the Chinese are running rings around us,"" Hacker says. ""I'm suggesting we're teaching too much mathematics to too many people. Not everybody has to know calculus. If you're going to become an aeronautical engineer, fine. But most of us aren't"".Instead, Hacker is pushing for more courses like the one he teaches at Queens College: Numeracy 101. There, his students of ""citizen statistics"" learn to analyze public information like the federal budget and corporate reports. Such courses, Hacker argues, are a remedy for the numerical illiteracy of adults who have completed high-level math like algebra but are unable to calculate the price of, say, a carpet by area.Hacker's argument has met with opposition from other math educators who say what's needed is to help students develop a better relationship with math earlier, rather than teaching them less math altogether.Maria Droujkova is a founder of Natural Math, and has taught basic calculus concepts to 5-year-olds. For Droujkova, high-level math is important, and what it could use in American classrooms is an injection of childlike wonder.""Make mathematics more available,"" Droujkova says. ""Redesign it so it's more accessible to more kinds of people: young children, adults who worry about it, adults who may have had bad experiences"".Pamela Harris, a lecturer at the University of Texas at Austin, has a similar perspective. Harris says that American education is suffering from an epidemic of ""fake math"", an emphasis on rote memorization of formulas and steps, rather than an understanding of how math can influence the ways we see the world.Andrew Hacker, for the record, remains skeptical.""I'm going to leave it to those who are in mathematics to work out the ways to make their subject interesting and exciting so students want to take it,"" Hacker says. ""All that I ask is that alternatives be offered instead of putting all of us on the road to calculus"".",教育、数学,教育

22,"As the latest crop of students pen their undergraduate application form and weigh up their options, it may be worth considering just how the point, purpose and value of a degree has changed and what Generation Z need to consider as they start the third stage of their educational journey.Millennials were told that if you did well in school, got a decent degree, you would be set up for life. But that promise has been found wanting. As degrees became universal, they became devalued. Education was no longer a secure route of social mobility. Today, 28 per cent of graduates in the UK are in non-graduate roles, a percentage which is double the average among the OECD countries.Thankfully, there are signs that this is already happening, with Generation Z seeking to learn from their millennial predecessors, even if parents and teachers tend to be still set in the degree mindset. Employers have long seen the advantages of hiring school leavers who often prove themselves to be more committed and loyal employees than graduates. Many too are seeing the advantages of scrapping a degree requirement for certain roles.For those for whom a degree is the desired route, consider that this may well be the first of many. In this age of generalists, it pays to have specific knowledge or skills. Postgraduates now earn 40 per cent more than graduates. When more and more of us have a degree, it makes sense to have two.It is unlikely that Generation Z will be done with education at 18 or 21; they will need to be constantly upskilling throughout their career to stay employable. It has been estimated that this generation, due to the pressures of technology, the wish for personal fulfilment and desire for diversity, will work for 17 different employers over the course of their working life and have five different careers. Education, and not just knowledge gained on campus, will be a core part of Generation Z's career trajectory.Older generations often talk about their degree in the present and personal tense: ""I am a geographer"" or ""I am a classicist"". Their sons or daughters would never say such a thing; it's as if they already know that their degree won’t define them in the same way.",教育、学历、就业,教育
23,"Enlightening, challenging, stimulating, fun. These were some of the words that Nature readers used to describe their experience of art-science collaborations in a series of articles on partnerships between artists and researchers. Nearly 40% of the roughly 350 people who responded to an accompanying poll said, they had collaborated with artists; and almost all said they would consider doing so in future.Such an encouraging result is not surprising. Scientists are increasingly seeking out visual artists to help them communicate their work to new audiences. ""Artists help scientists reach a broader audience and make emotional connections that enhance learning,"" one respondent said.One example of how artists and scientists have together rocked the scenes came last month when the Sydney Symphony Orchestra performed a reworked version of Antonio Vivaldi’s The Four Seasons. They reimagined the 300-year-old score by injecting the latest climate prediction data for each season, which provided by Monash University’s Climate Change Communication Research Hub. The performance was a creative call to action ahead of November's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, UK.But a genuine partnership must be a two-way street. Fewer artists than scientists responded to the Nature poll, however, several respondents noted that artists do not simply assist scientists with their communication requirements. Nor should their work be considered only as an object of study. The alliances are most valuable when scientists and artists have a shared stake in a project, are able to jointly design it and can critique each other's work. Such an approach can both prompt new research as well as result in powerful art.More than half a century ago, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology opened its Center for Advanced Visual Studies (CAYS) to explore the role of technology in culture.The founders deliberately focused their projects around light hence the ""visual studies"" in the name. Light was a something that both artists and scientists bad an interest in, and therefore could form the basis of collaboration. As science and technology progressed, and divided into more sub-disciplines, the centre was simultaneously looking to a time when leading researchers could also be artists, writers and poets, and vice versa.Nature's poll findings suggest that this trend is as strong as ever, but, to make a collaboration work, both sides need to invest time, and embrace surprise and challenge. The reach of art-science tie-ups needs to go beyond the necessary purpose of research communication, and participants must not fall into the trap of stereotyping each other. Artists and scientists alike are immersed in discovery and invention, and challenge and critique are core to both, too.",科学、艺术、合作,科学、文化
24,"The personal grievance provisions of New Zealand's Employment Relations Act 2000 (ERA) prevent an employer from firing an employee without good cause. Instead, dismissals must be justified. Employers must both show cause and act in a procedurally fair way.Personal grievance procedures were designed to guard the jobs of ordinary workers from ""unjustified dismissals"". The premise was that the common law of contract lacked sufficient safeguards for workers against arbitrary conduct by management. Long gone are the days when a boss could simply give an employee contractual notice.But these provisions create difficulties for businesses when applied to highly paid managers and executives. As countless boards and business owners will attest, constraining firms from firing poorly performing, high-earning managers is a handbrake on boosting productivity and overall performance. The difference between C-grade and A-grade managers may very well be the difference between business success or failure. Between preserving the jobs of ordinary workers or losing them. Yet mediocrity is no longer enough to justify a dismissal.Consequently and paradoxically, laws introduced to protect the jobs of ordinary workers may be placing those jobs at risk.If not placing jobs at risk, to the extent employment protection laws constrain business owners from dismissing under-performing managers, those laws act as a constraint on firm productivity and therefore on workers’ wages. Indeed, in ""An International Perspective on New Zealand's Productivity Paradox"" (2014), the Productivity Commission singled out the low quality of managerial capabilities as a cause of the country's poor productivity growth record.Nor are highly paid managers themselves immune from the harm caused by the ERA's unjustified dismissal procedures. Because employment protection laws make it costlier to fire an employee, employers are more cautious about hiring new staff. This makes it harder for the marginal manager to gain employment. And firms pay staff less because firms carry the burden of the employment arrangement going wrong.Society also suffers from excessive employment protections. Stringent job dismissal regulations adversely affect productivity growth and hamper both prosperity and overall well-being.Across the Tasman Sea, Australia deals with the unjustified dismissal paradox by excluding employees earning above a specified “high-income threshold” from the protection of its unfair dismissal laws. In New Zealand, a 2016 private members’ Bill tried to permit firms and high-income employees to contract out of the unjustified dismissal regime. However, the mechanisms proposed were unwieldy and the Bill was voted down following the change in government later that year.",就业、劳动保护,商业、法律
25,"How can the train operators possibly justify yet another increase to rail passenger fares. It has become a grimly reliable annual ritual: every January the cost of travelling by train rises, imposing a significant extra burden on those who have no option but to use the rail network to get to work or otherwise. This year’s rise, an average of 27 per cent, may be a fraction lower than last year’s, but it is still well above the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) measure of inflation.Successive governments have permitted such increases on the grounds that the cost of investing in and running the rail network should be borne by those who use it, rather than the general taxpayer. Why, the argument goes, should a car-driving pensioner from Lincolnshire have to subsidise the daily commute of a stockbroker from Surrey. Equally, there is a sense that the travails of commuters in the South East, many of whom will face among the biggest rises, have received too much attention compared to those who must endure the relatively poor infrastructure of the Midlands and the North.However, over the past 12 months, those commuters have also experienced some of the worst rail strikes in years. It is all very well train operators trumpeting the improvements they are making to the network, but passengers should be able to expect a basic level of service for the substantial sums they are now paying to travel. The responsibility for the latest wave of strikes rests on the unions. However, there is a strong case that those who have been worst affected by industrial action should receive compensation for the disruption they have suffered.The Government has pledged to change the law to introduce a minimum service requirement so that, even when strikes occur, services can continue to operate. This should form part of a wider package of measures to address the long-running problems on Britain’s railways. Yes, more investment is needed, but passengers will not be willing to pay more indefinitely if they must also endure cramped, unreliable services, punctuated by regular chaos when timetables are changed, or planned maintenance is managed incompetently. The threat of nationalisation may have been seen off for now, but it will return with a vengeance if the justified anger of passengers is not addressed in short order.",交通,技术
26,"Today someone reading a review of a philosophical book in the New York Review of Books might well encounter the word ""intentionality"". Yet few reviewers ever say what the word means. Not that the word is meaningless; rather, it has become a chapter-heading word: a word which stands for a whole range of topics and issues rather than for one definite subject. In particular, the following facts are commonly cited as examples of “intentionality”: (1) the fact that words, sentences, and other “representations” have meaning; (2) the fact that representations may refer to some actually existing thing or each of a number of actually existing things; (3) the fact that representations may be about something which does not exist; and (4) the fact that a state of mind may have a ""state of affairs"" as its object, as when someone says, ""she believes that he is trustworthy,"" ""he hopes that his boss will get fired,"" ""she fears that there won't be food in the house"".When the computer revolution burst upon the world, it was widely expected (and claimed) that computer models would explain the nature of these various phenomena. In short, people expected that a reductive account of the various topics included under the chapter heading ""intentionality"" would be given. Now that this has proved not so easy, a number of thinkers are beginning to suggest that it isn't so bad if this can't be done; intentionality is only a feature of ""folk psychology"" anyway. If a first-class scientific account of intentional facts and phenomena can't be given, that is not because scientific reductionism is not the right line to take in metaphysics, but rather it is because there is, so to speak, nothing there to reduce. I want to argue that both attitudes are mistaken; that intentionality won't be reduced and won't go away.The claim that ""intentionality won't be reduced and won't go away"" has sometimes been called ""Brentano's thesis,"" after a philosopher who is (not completely accurately) credited with defending it in the latter part of the nineteenth century. Sometimes the view is stated as a positive claim: the claim that intentionality is a primitive phenomenon, in fact the phenomenon that relates thought and thing, minds and the external world.In a sense, this positive view follows immediately from the negative one, but there is a joker in the pack. The joker is the old philosophical problem about the One and the Many. If one assumes that whenever we have diverse phenomena gathered together under a single name, There Must Be Something They All Have in Common, hen indeed it will follow that there is a single phenomenon (and, if it is not reducible, it must be ""primitive"") corresponding to intentionality.",哲学,文化
27,"As he was the first to theorize in a systematic way about so many other things, so Aristotle was the first thinker to theorize in a systematic way about meaning and reference. In De interpretatione he laid out a scheme which has proved remarkably robust. According to this scheme, when we understand a word or any other “sign,” we associate that word with a ""concept"". This concept determines what the word refers to. Two millennia later, one can find the same theory in John Stuart Mill's Logic, and in the present century one finds variants of this picture in the writings of Bertrand Russell, Gottlob Frege, Rudolf Carnap, and many other important philosophers. Something like this picture also appears to be built into the English language. Etymologically, meaning is related to mind. To mean something was probably, in the oldest usage, just to have it in mind. Be this as it may, the picture is that there is something in the mind that picks out the objects in the environment that we talk about. When such a something (call it a ""concept"") is associated with a sign, it becomes the meaning of the sign.This picture, whether we trace it back to Aristotle or to the meta­physics built into our language, is worth looking at closely. Let us write down the assumptions that constitute the picture for the purpose of inspection. (In writing them down, instead of the word ""concept"" I shall use the currently popular term ""mental representation,"" because the idea that concepts are just that representations in the mind is itself an essential part of the picture).1 Every word he uses is associated in the mind of the speaker with a certain mental representation.2 Two words are synonymous (have the same meaning) just in case they are associated with the same mental representation by the speakers who use those words.3 The mental representation determines what the word refers to, if anything.These assumptions are likely to seem self-evident, but I believe that they are in fact false, and it is necessary to appreciate the extent to before we can make progress in any discussion having to do with meaning or mental representation.To say that they are false is to say that there cannot be such things as ""mental representations"" which simultaneously satisfy all three of these conditions. I do not deny that there are, in some sense, mental representations. We often think with the aid of words and pictures and other signs, and it may be that unconscious thought is even richer in the use of representations than we know. Certainly computational models or the mind rely heavily on the idea of processing representations. But remember that the Aristotelian theory of meaning with which we have been stuck these two thousand-plus years doesn’t just say that we think in terms of mental representations. It is essential to the theory that sameness and difference of these representations is what sameness of meaning is about; that when we say that two words do or do not have the same meaning, what we are saying is that they are or are not associated with the same mental representations. It is also part of the Aristotelian picture with which we have been stuck these two thousand-plus years that sameness and difference of the associated mental representations is what two words do or do not refer to the same things. Both of these latter assumptions, I shall argue, are false.",哲学、亚里士多德、质疑,文化
28,"Fodor's proposal was that words (in ""Mentalese"") are semantically associated with perceptual prototypes (and thus with ""functions of the observable properties"" of various things). We have a perceptual prototype of the dog, and we often recognize that an animal we meet conforms to that perceptual prototype before we recognize what particular sort of dog it is, terrier, retriever, collie, or whatever. Indeed, this fact, the fact that we have a stereotype of a dog or a typewriter or a table or a tree, has long been noticed by philosophers and psychologists. In the days of Berkeley and Hume, such prototypes were referred to as ""ideas,"" and there was considerable discussion about their nature. Some seventeenth-century psychologists thought that they are simply mental images; but although the study of mental images continues to be an active topic today, there are well-known difficulties with this view. My perceptual prototype of a dress, for example, may include a certain shape, but it does not include any particular color. Yet any particular image of a thing, for example, a dress, must have some particular color. In short, my perceptual prototype of a dress is more abstract than any one mental image. (A problem that was much discussed in the seventeenth century). Another approach to perceptual prototypes (or stereotypes) simply identifies them with verbal responses. Thus, if upon being asked to describe a ""typical tree,"" I reply that I would expect a typical tree to be at least fifteen feet tall and to shed its leaves in winter, then being at least fifteen feet tall and being deciduous would be counted as parts of my stereotype of a tree. This notion of a stereotype is of no use for Fodor’s purposes, because stereotypes (in this sense) are words and phrases, and Fodor’s whole purpose is to get to something which lies behind, something which is deeper than, words. However, Fodor believes that one can escape the trap question, ""Are perceptual prototypes themselves verbal, or are they images."" by proposing a third alternative, derived from modem computer science.It is plausible, in terms of present-day brain research, work on artificial intelligence, and so on, that the brain contains devices for recognizing patterns (or more generally, ""functions of observable properties""). Such devices are one kind of module, in Fodor's sense. When I have learned to recognize dogs, then, Fodor postulates, somewhere in my visual system I have built up a subroutine in a little computer, one which functions independently of general intelligence, which has the function of recognizing things that exhibit particular patterns. It is quite possible for a pattern-recognition device to recognize shape without recognizing color. Thus the difficulty just raised against the identification of perceptual prototypes with images does not bar the identification of perceptual prototypes with the outputs of particular subroutines executed by modules.",哲学、言语,文化
29,"Last year marked the third year in a row of when Indonesia’s bleak rate of deforestation has slowed pace.One reason for the turnaround may be the country’s antipoverty program.In 2007, Indonesia started phasing in a program that gives money to its poorest residents under certain conditions, such as requiring people to keep kids in school or get regular medical care.Called conditional cash transfers or CCTs, these social assistance programs are designed to reduce inequality and break the cycle of poverty.They’re already used in dozens of countries worldwide.In Indonesia, the program has provided enough food and medicine to substantially reduce severe growth problems among children.But CCT programs don’t generally consider effects on the environment.In fact, poverty alleviation and environmental protection are often viewed as conflicting goals, says Paul Ferraro, an economist at Johns Hopkins University.That’s because economic growth can be correlated with environmental degradation, while protecting the environment is sometimes correlated with greater poverty.However, those correlations don't prove cause and effect.The only previous study analyzing causality, based on an area in Mexico that had instituted CCTs, supported the traditional view.There, as people got more money, some of them may have more cleared land for cattle to raise for meat, Ferraro says.Such programs do not have to negatively affect the environment, though.Ferraro wanted to see if Indonesia’s poverty-alleviation program was affecting deforestation.Indonesia has the third-largest area of tropical forest in the world and one of the highest deforestation rates.Ferraro analyzed satellite data showing annual forest loss from 2008 to 2012, including during Indonesia’s phase-in of the antipoverty program, in 7468 forested villages across 15 provinces.We see that the program is associated with a 30 percent reduction in deforestation, Ferraro says.That’s likely because the rural poor are using the money as makeshift insurance policies against inclement weather, Ferraro says.Typically, if rains are delayed, people may clear land to plant more rice to supplement their harvests.Whether this research translates elsewhere is anybody’s guess.Ferraro suggests the results may transfer to other parts of Asia, due to commonalities such as the importance of growing rice and market access.And regardless of transferability, the study shows that what’s good for people may also be good for the environment.Even if this program didn’t reduce poverty, Ferraro says, the value of the avoided deforestation just for carbon dioxide emissions alone is more than the program costs.",时事政治、贫困问题、环境保护,新闻
30,"As a historian who’s always searching for the text or the image that makes us reevaluate the past, I’ve become preoccupied with looking for photographs that show our Victorian ancestors smiling (what better way to shatter the image of 19th-century prudery). I’ve found quite a few, and, since I started posting them on Twitter, they have been causing quite a stir. People have been surprised to see evidence that Victorians had fun and could, and did, laugh. They are noting that the Victorians suddenly seem to become more human as the hundred-or-so years that separate us fade away through our common experience of laughter.Of course, I need to concede that my collection of ‘Smiling Victorians’ makes up only a tiny percentage of the vast catalogue of photographic portraiture created between 1840 and 1900, the majority of which show sitters posing miserably and stiffly in front of painted backdrops, or staring absently into the middle distance.During the 1840s and 1850s, in the early days of photography, exposure times were notoriously long: the daguerreotype photographic method (producing an image on a silvered copper plate) could take several minutes to complete, resulting in blurred images as sitters shifted position or adjusted their limbs. The thought of holding a fixed grin as the camera performed its magical duties was too much to contemplate, and so a non-committal blank stare became the norm.But exposure times were much quicker by the 1880s, and the introduction of the Box Brownie and other portable cameras meant that, though slow by today’s digital standards, the exposure was almost instantaneous.Spontaneous smiles were relatively easy to capture by the 1890s, so we must look elsewhere for an explanation of why Victorians still hesitated to smile.One explanation might be the loss of dignity displayed through a cheesy grin. Nature gave us lips to conceal our teeth, ran one popular Victorian maxim, alluding to the fact that before the birth of proper dentistry, mouths were often in a shocking state of hygiene. A flashing set of healthy and clean, regular ‘pearly whites’ was a rare sight in Victorian society, the preserve of the super-rich (and even then, dental hygiene was not guaranteed).A toothy grin (especially when there were gaps or blackened gnashers) lacked class: drunks, tramps, and music hall performers might gum and grin with a smile as wide as Carroll’s gum-exposing Cheshire Cat, but it was not a becoming look for properly bred persons. Even Mark Twain, a man who enjoyed a hearty laugh, said that when it came to photographic portraits there could be nothing more damning than a silly smile fixed forever.",摄影,文化

40,"From the early days of broadband, advocates for consumers and web-based companies worried that the cable and phone companies selling broadband connections had the power and incentive to favor affiliated websites over their rivals’. That is the reason why there has been such a strong demand for rules that would prevent broadband providers from picking winners and losers online, preserving the freedom and innovation that have been the lifeblood of the Internet.Yet that demand has been almost impossible to fill-in part because of pushback from broadband providers, anti-regulatory conservatives and the courts. A federal appeals court weighed in again Tuesday, but instead of providing a badly needed resolution, it only prolonged the fight. At issue before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit was the latest take of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on net neutrality, adopted on a party-line vote in 2017. The Republican-penned order not only eliminated the strict net neutrality rules the FCC had adopted when it had a Democratic majority in 2015, but rejected the commission’s authority to require broadband providers to do much of anything. The order also declared that state and local governments couldn’t regulate broadband providers either.The commission argued that other agencies would protect against anti-competitive behavior, such as a broadband-providing conglomerate like favoring its own video-streaming service at the expense of Netflix and Apple TV.Yet the FCC also ended the investigations of broadband providers that imposed data caps on their rivals’ streaming services but not their own.On Tuesday, the appeals court unanimously upheld the 2017 order deregulating broadband providers, citing a Supreme Court ruling from 2005 that upheld a similarly deregulatory move. But Judge Patricia Millett rightly argued in a concurring opinion that the result is unhinged from the realities of modem broadband service, and said Congress or the Supreme Court could intervene to avoid trapping Internet regulation in technological anachronism.In the meantime, the court threw out the FCC’s attempt to block all state rules on net neutrality, while preserving the commission’s power to preempt individual state laws that undermine its order. That means more battles like the one now going on between the Justice Department and California, which enacted a tough net neutrality law in the wake of the FCC’s abdication.The endless legal battles and back-and-forth at the FCC cry out for Congress to act. It needs to give the commission explicit authority once and for all to bar broadband providers from meddling in the traffic on their network and to create clear rules protecting openness and innovation online.",时事政治、网络、法律,新闻、法律
41,"A group of Labour MPs, among them Yvette Cooper, are bringing in the new year with a call to institute a UK “town of culture” award. The proposal is that it should sit alongside the existing city of culture title, which was held by Hull in 2017, and has been awarded to Coventry for 2021. Cooper and her colleagues argue that the success of the crown for Hull, where it brought in 220 million pounds of investment and an avalanche of arts, ought not to be confined to cities. Britain’s towns, it is true, are not prevented from applying, but they generally lack the resources to put together a bid to beat their bigger competitors. A town of culture award could, it is argued, become an annual event, attracting funding and creating jobs.Some might see the proposal as a booby prize for the fact that Britain is no longer able to apply for the much more prestigious title of European capital of culture, a sought-after award bagged by Glasgow in 1990 and Liverpool in 2008. A cynic might speculate that the UK is on the verge of disappearing into an endless fever of self-celebration in its desperation to reinvent itself for the post-Brexit world: after town of culture, who knows what will follow, village of culture, suburb of culture, hamlet of culture.It is also wise to recall that such titles are not a cure-all. A badly run “year of culture” washes in and washes out of a place like the tide, bringing prominence for a spell but leaving no lasting benefits to the community. The really successful holders of such titles are those that do a great deal more than fill hotel bedrooms and bring in high-profile arts events and good press for a year. They transform the aspirations of the people who live there; they nudge the self-image of the city into a bolder and more optimistic light. It is hard to get right, and requires a remarkable degree of vision, as well as cooperation between city authorities, the private sector, community groups and cultural organizations. But it can be done: Glasgow’s year as European capital of culture can certainly be seen as one of a complex series of factors that have turned the city into the powerhouse of art, music and theatre that it remains today.A “town of culture” could be not just about the arts but about honoring a town’s peculiarities, helping sustain its high street, supporting local facilities and above all celebrating its people.

42,"Scientific publishing has long been a license to print money. Scientists need journals to publish research, so they will supply the articles without monetary reward. Other scientists perform the work of peer review also for free, because it's a central element in the acquisition of status and the production of scientific knowledge.With the content of papers secured for free, the publisher needs only find a market for its journal. Until this century, university libraries were not very price sensitive. Scientific publishers report profit margins approaching 40% on their operations, at a time when the rest of the publishing industry is in an existential crisis.The Dutch giant Elsevier, which claims to publish 25% of the scientific papers produced in the world, made profits of more than 900 million pounds last year, while UK universities alone spent more than 210 million pounds in 2016 to enable researchers to access their own publicly funded research; both figures seem to rise unstoppably despite increasingly desperate efforts to change them.The most drastic, and thoroughly illegal, reaction has been the emergence of Sci-Hub, a kind of global photocopier for scientific papers, set up in 2012, which now claims to offer access to every paywalled article published since 2015. The success of Sci-Hub, which relies on researchers passing on copies they have themselves legally accessed, shows the legal ecosystem has lost legitimacy among its users and must be transformed so that it works for all participants.In Britain the move towards open access publishing has been driven by funding bodies. In some ways it has been very successful. More than half of all British scientific research is now published under open access terms: either freely available from the moment of publication, or paywalled for a year or more so that the publishers can make a profit before being placed on general release.Yet the new system has not yet worked out any cheaper for the universities. Publishers have responded to the demand that they make their product free to readers by charging their writers fees to cover the costs of preparing an article. These range from around 500 pounds to 5000 dollars, and apparently the work gets more expensive the more that publishers do it. A report last year pointed out that the costs both of subscriptions and of these “article preparation costs” had been steadily rising at a rate above inflation.In some ways the scientific publishing model resembles the economy of the social internet: labor is provided free in exchange for the hope of status, while huge profits are made by a few big firms who run the market places. In both cases, we need a rebalancing of power.",版权、论文发表,法律
43,"Progressives often support diversity mandates as a path to equality and a way to level the playing field. But too often such policies are an insincere form of virtue-signaling that benefits the most privileged and does little to help average people. A pair of bills sponsored by Massachusetts state Senator Jason and House Speaker Pro Tempore Patricia Haddad, to ensure “gender parity” on boards and commissions, provide a case in point.Haddad and Lewis are concerned that more than half the state-government boards are less than 40 percent female. In order to ensure that elite women have more such opportunities, they have proposed imposing government quotas. If the bills become law, state boards and commissions will be required to set aside 50 percent of board seats for women by 2022.The bills are similar to a measure recently adopted in California, which last year became the first state to require gender quotas for private companies. In signing the measure, California Governor Jerry Brown admitted that the law, which expressly classifies people on the basis of sex, is probably unconstitutional.The US Supreme Court frowns on sex-based classifications unless they are designed to address an “important” policy interest. Because the California law applies to all boards, even where there is no history of prior discrimination, courts are likely to rule that the law violates the constitutional guarantee of “equal protection”. But are such government mandates even necessary. Female participation on corporate boards may not currently mirror the percentage of women in the generalThe number of women on corporate boards has been steadily increasing without government interference. According to a study by Researcher Catalyst, between 2010 and 2015 the share of women on the boards of global corporations increased by around 54 percent.Requiring companies to make gender the primary qualification for board membership will let less experienced private sector boards. That's what happened when Norway adopted a nationwide corporate gender quota.Writing in The New Republic, Alice Lee notes that increasing the number of opportunities for board membership without increasing the pool of qualified women to serve on such boards has led to a “golden skirt” phenomenon, where the same elite women scoop up multiple seats on a variety of boards.Next time somebody pushes corporate quotas as a way to promote gender equity, remember that such policies are largely self-serving measures that make their sponsors feel good but do little to help average women.",性别平等,社会科学
44,"W V Quine would no doubt say that the difficulties with “mentalism” pointed out in the preceding chapters are grist for his mill. Quine has long contended that it is a mistake to think of meanings as objects in the head; that the notion of synonymy is hopelessly vague, at least if our interests are theoretical; and that even reference is “inscrutable” when we are dealing with a language other than our own. In our own language, after it has been translated into a “regimented notation” (that is, predicate calculus), it is easy to specify the extension of “refers to”. The “disquotational” truths that “cat” refers to cats, “electron” refers to electrons, “superego” refers to superegos and so on, suffice to determine the extension of the relation “refers to” when that relation is restricted to the “home language”. Every question of sameness of reference, for example, “Does ‘water’ have the same reference as ‘H2O’”, just reduces to the corresponding first-order question (“Is water H2O?”).To the objection that translation into a regimented notation presupposes some notion of sameness of meaning, Quine said that such translation is a “free creation,” not a discovery of some content already there. Quine thinks of unregimented natural language as a “System of noises which has the function of helping us to anticipate stimulations of our nerve endings,” but to which no serious scientific notion of reference or truth is applicable.To the objection that any theory of the propositional attitudes presupposes that we can compare utterances made in different languages (or thoughts “subvocalized” in different languages) for sameness or difference of meaning, Quine’s response is that the propositional attitudes belong to folk psychology, not to science. We should settle for behaviorism, in Quine’s view.I cannot discuss here the deep philosophical reasons that Quine offers in support of these views. My plan in this book is to evaluate the prospects of a particular philosophical research program, or rather of a family of research programs, without allowing the discussion to broaden into a discussion of metaphysical issues in general. Of course this is not completely possible; every philosophical program touches on deep metaphysical issues. But there is a fundamental difference in what may be called “level” between the question “Can a reductionist account of broad content (respectively narrow content) be given?” and such questions as “Is there a language-independent world at all?” Here I intend to confine myself largely to questions at what may be considered the “shallower” level; questions that face philosophers who consider themselves “scientific realists”. What bearing the results we obtain at the shallower, or less metaphysical, level have on contemporary discussions in metaphysics will be briefly discussed in the final chapter; but for the most part, this question will be left for a future book.",哲学,文化
45,"Many years ago, I published a series of papers in which I proposed a model of the mind which became widely known under the name “functionalism”. According to this model, psychological states (“believing that p,” “desiring that p,” “considering whether p,” and so on) are simply “computational states” of the brain. The proper way to think of the brain is as a digital computer. Our psychology is to be described as the software of this computer, its “functional Organization”.According to the version of functionalism that I originally proposed, mental states can be defined in terms of Turing machine states and loadings of the memory (the paper tape of the Turing machine).The upshot of our discussion for the philosophy of mind is that propositional attitudes, as philosophers call them, that is, such things as believing that snow is white and feeling certain that the cat is on the mat, are not “states” of the human brain and nervous system considered in isolation from the social and nonhuman environment. A fortiori, they are not “functional states”, that is, states definable in terms of parameters which would enter into a software description of the organism. Functionalism, construed as the thesis that propositional attitudes are just computational states of the brain, cannot be correct.One way of trying to meet this objection was discussed in an earlier chapter. This is to say, “Yes, but a component of meaning, call it ‘content,’ and a similar component of the propositional attitudes is ‘in the head,’ and this component could be a computational state of the brain in the case of each ‘meaning’ and each ‘propositional attitude’”. Certainly, one must be in an appropriate physical state, an appropriate computational state, and so on, to believe that there is a cat on the mat, but not in the sense that there is one physical state or one computational state that one must be in to believe that there is a cat on the mat. It was an insight of functionalism to point out that the different physical states one might be in while believing that a cat is on the mat need not have anything “in common” that can be specified in physical or chemical terms. Just as this was an insight, so the upshot of our discussion here was that the different computational states one might be in while believing that a cat is on the mat need not have anything “in common” that can be specified in computational terms.",哲学、心理学,文化
46,"To the difficulties with functionalism pointed out in the preceding chapter the obvious response is to say, “Very well, the difficulties you raise do show that we cannot hope to have the Master Algorithm for Interpretation in practice. But remember, we set out to discuss what is possible in principle. In principle there could be such an algorithm or such a theory even if no human being could understand”.One problem with this response is that even if one grants that there are some things which are true or false whether or not human beings could ever know that they are true or false, say, that there was a rabbit in the area where my house now stands at 12 noon on September 14, or that there are intelligent beings in some other galaxy, or that the number of stars in the first star cluster is the same as the number of stars in the second cluster, still, we at least know what sort of thing would make these statements true or false. But if we ask whether there is an ideal theory of interpretation, or, at least, a class of adequate “rational reconstructions” of the procedure of interpretation, then it is not clear that we know what would make the answer “yes there is” or “no there isn’t” true, not even if we say that the procedure is restricted to human beings (but not to any particular culture or time period). What is it to be “ideal” or “adequate,” after all. Normally we think of the “adequacy” of a rational reconstruction as consisting in its agreement with some body of practice and some set of intuitions. Whose practice and whose intuitions are the Ideal Theory of Interpretation (or an Ideal Theory of Interpretation, if there is more than one candidate) supposed to agree with. Not those of human beings, since we have seen that no human being could understand an ideal theory of interpretation that “worked” for arbitrary human cultures and languages. The practice and the intuitions of a rational being smarter than we. What would define “rational” for such a being. No doubt we could be sure that some being we might meet is smarter than a human in certain respects (as a child can be sure that a grownup is, in certain respects, smarter than the child); but could we know that such a being never makes a mistake, even when he talks about matters as delicate as human intentions and human cultures. Are we just to accept the notion of such a being (or the notion of an “adequate rational reconstruction”) as an unreduced notion. But then, why should we not just accept the propositional attitudes themselves as unreduced notions.",哲学,文化
47,"The end of an investigation like the one just completed is an appropriate time to reexamine the reasons for undertaking the investigation in the first place; for no philosophical investigation looks quite the same at the end as it did when one started. My reasons for undertaking this project were many. Some readers of the preceding pages have expressed surprise at what they called my “realist tone”; as though, by reacting to “mentalist” and “functionalist” proposals in the way that I have, I was renouncing my supposed “antirealism”. Others have asked me to explain where the present inquiry “fits in” to my ongoing project of developing a third way (“internal realism”) between classical realism and antirealism. In this closing chapter I want to respond to these requests and reactions.Let me begin by admitting that I have long felt an approach or avoidance conflict where “metaphysical realism” is concerned. In various places I have described metaphysical realism as a bundle of intimately associated philosophical ideas about truth: the ideas that truth is a matter of Correspondence and that it exhibits Independence (of what humans do or could find out), Bivalence, and Uniqueness (there cannot be more than one complete and true description of Reality); but I do not think that this characterization caught the appeal of metaphysical realism to me, which was, of course, a grave defect. What I used to find seductive about metaphysical realism is the idea that the way to solve philosophical problems is to construct a much more better scientific picture of the world. That idea retains the ancient principle that Being is prior to Knowledge, while giving it a distinctively modem twist: all philosophers must be a good “futurist”, anticipate for us how science will solve our philosophical problems. From this idea I was led naturally to the thought that science should be understood “without philosophical reinterpretation”. In such an outlook, Independence, Uniqueness, Bivalence, and Correspondence are regulative ideas that the final scientific image is expected to live up to, as well as metaphysical assumptions that guarantee that such a final scientific resolution of all philosophical problems must be possible.To fully understand the appeal of scientific realism, one does not necessarily have to know anything about science, Bernard Williams’s Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, for example, exhibits an enthusiasm for scientific realism (“the absolute conception of the world”) coupled with complete innocence of actual scientific knowledge. But for someone like me who has mastered a certain amount of mathematics and physics, the situation is quite different. I know what a real scientific theory looks like; and the attractiveness of scientific realism is counterbalanced by an unwillingness to accept vague talk about what science can achieve as a substitute for at least a plausible sketch of a genuine scientific theory with real explanatory power. Hence what I described as my “approach or avoidance” conflict.",哲学、现实主义,文化
48,"I mentioned earlier that there is an alternative account of narrow content due to Ned Block. Block’s theory resembles Fodor’s in accepting the distinction between “narrow content” and “broad content”. Also as in Fodor’s theory, “narrow content” is supposed to be a mentalistic notion, narrow contents depend only on what is inside the speaker’s head and can be described without taking into account the extension of a term or sentence. So that “water” has the same narrow content on Earth and on Twin Earth but not the same broad content, as in Fodor’s theory.Here the resemblance to Fodor’s theory ends; although Block agrees with the dominant computational approach in thinking of the mind or brain as computing with “representations” in a “language of thought,” he does not take a stand on whether this is an innate language (Fodor’s Mentalese) or simply the local natural language (suitably transcribed. into neuronal terms), nor does he regard narrow content as a sense of “meaning”. He does, however, sometimes use the expressions “broad meaning” and “narrow meaning,” and also speaks of “two ways of individuating thought contents”, just as Fodor does. Rather than regarding the notion of “meaning” as ambiguous and taking “narrow content” and “broad content” to be the two senses (or rational reconstructions of the two senses), Block regards meaning as, in effect, the ordered pair of narrow content and broad content. For Block, narrow content is one of the two factors determining meaning, rather than a kind of meaning (or at least this is his fallback position).Moreover, narrow content is not identified with a function of observable properties, as it was in Fodor’s (former) theory. Rather, it is identified with “conceptual role”. What is conceptual role. Block gives a number of people credit (he even cites Wittgenstein’s remark that for many purposes we can think of meaning as use as representing this approach). Perhaps the clearest origin of the notion is in the work of Wilfrid Sellars, who describes language as having “language-entry rules” (think of these as rules saying that when the speaker has certain experiences, he is to put certain sentences in the “belief box”), “language-language” rules (rules that when the speaker accepts certain sentences, he is to accept certain other sentences), and “language-exit rules” (rules saying that when the speaker has certain sentences in the belief and desire boxes, he is to perform certain bodily movements, or say certain words and so on). The “language-language” rules are not all required to be analytic, there can be material rules of inference, according to Sellars.The important thing (in the Sellars-Block conception) is that (apart from the reference to experiences, Block would no doubt replace this by a reference to outputs from Fodor’s pattern-recognition modules, in the case of the language-entry rules, and to bodily movements in the case of the language-exit rules) the conceptual role of the formulas of a language can be described entirely syntactically. If we had the computational description of the syntactic processes into which words and sentences enter, then we would be in a position to computationally define the relation of similarity of narrow content: words are similar in narrow content if they have similar “conceptual roles” (in the Sellars-Block sense) in their respective languages. And if words are similar in narrow content and also have the same reference (or better, the same broad content), then they are similar in meaning.",哲学,文化
49,"When I speak of “defining” reference and the various propositional attitudes, I am not, of course, thinking of finding an “analytic” definition, one which analyzes the “concept” or “meaning” of “refers to,” “believes,” “desires,” and so on. No one any longer believes that semantic and propositional-attitude predicates are semantically or conceptually reducible to physicalistic (or computational) predicates. The question is whether these semantic and propositional-attitude properties and relations are “reducible” to physical-cum-computational properties and relations in the way in which (to use a familiar example) the temperature of an ideal gas is reducible to mean molecular kinetic energy.When we say that temperature has been reduced to mean molecular kinetic energy, we are claiming more than just that “temperature” is coextensive with suitably measured mean molecular kinetic energy. These two magnitudes could be coextensive (equal in numerical value in all cases) even if temperature and mean molecular kinetic energy were distinct physical parameters (as long as the two parameters were one-to-one related by a suitable physical law). They could even be coextensive by accident (suppose temperature and mean molecular kinetic energy differed only in a class of physically possible cases which were not ever produced by investigators and which did not occur spontaneously in nature). When physicists say that temperature has been reduced to mean molecular kinetic energy, they are claiming that (1) the relation between mean molecular kinetic energy and temperature is lawlike: there is no physically possible situation in which a body has a certain temperature and does not have the corresponding mean molecular kinetic energy. (2) The laws which “unreduced” (or “phenomenological,” in the physicists’, not the philosophers’, sense of “phenomenological”) temperature was supposed to obey are approximately obeyed by mean molecular kinetic energy. (3) The effects that “unreduced” temperature was supposed to explain are (to the extent that they really exist) explained by mean molecular kinetic energy. It is the second and third of these conditions that distinguish between correlation, even “lawlike” correlation (finding that one magnitude is a function of another), and reduction (finding that temperature is mean molecular kinetic energy).Applied to the present case, these conditions tell us that we must not say, for example, that reference as been reduced to some physical or computational relation unless (a) reference is coextensive with the relation in all physically possible systems, coextensive for all physically possible organisms and environments such that those organisms are capable of using language, referring and so on, in those environments. (b) The relation obeys (approximately) the “laws” that reference is supposed to obey in intuitive (or anthropological) belief about reference. (c) The presence of the relation explains the effects (to the extent that they really exist) that the intuitive or anthropological notion of reference was supposed to explain. Merely finding a functional relation which is coextensive with referring for those organisms that happen to refer (perhaps, by chance, there aren’t any other than human beings) would not be enough.",哲学,文化
50,"What we have just seen to hold in the case of my (former) account also holds for Lewis’s account. His account too says that to have psychological states is just to be a “model” of a certain theory. He too needs to restrict the notion of a “realizer” so that highly disjunctive physical states (like the ones used in the proof in the Appendix) do not count as realizers even if they satisfy the postulates of folk psychology. Lewis does this by requiring the realizers to have the metaphysical property he calls naturalness or elite. But this means that his theory requires that each organism to which folk psychology applies be a model for folk psychology in just the sense that my account in “Philosophy and Our Mental Life” required, that is, that such an organism possess one physical state per propositional attitude. But we have seen that we are not models of propositional-attitude theory in that (highly reductionist) sense.I can exploit my arguments to make a further point: folk psychology cannot play the explanatory role Lewis wishes it to play, the role of defining the propositional attitudes. If it could play this role, the “platitudes which are common knowledge among us” would already constitute a survey of all possible ways of having any belief that we can describe. And Lewis has not given us any reason to believe that they do this.Consider the belief that (apart from dirt) snow is normally white. Suppose someone who lives in a future super-scientific culture (and who speaks a language unrelated to any present-day language) has a belief that should be so interpreted. A problem in the radical interpretation of a language spoken by beings more sophisticated than we. How would this be determined using beliefs of our culture such that “everyone knows them, everyone knows that everyone knows them, and so on”.These future speakers might believe that snow is white on the basis of a quantum mechanical calculation. Perhaps it snows so rarely that that is now the “normal” way of fixing the belief that snow is white. So our platitudes about what “sensory stimulations” cause one to go into the mental state of believing that snow is white “with so-and-so probability” will not apply to these speakers. Imagine that they not only come to the belief in a different way than we, but that the sensory stimulations that suffice for us do not suffice for most of them, at least without lengthy calculation, they do not go immediately from the sensory stimulations to the “mental state”.",哲学、心理学,文化
